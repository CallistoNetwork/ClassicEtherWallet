### Purpose

ClassicEtherWallet was created because many users were having immense trouble setting up the command-line ethereum client on their computers. Therefore, created this browser-based GUI wallet to...
- Import client wallet files and presale wallet files.
- Generate wallets completely client side and provide raw private keys, JSON files, and paper version of the account.
- Bulk generate wallets
- Generate & send transactions
- We hope that it'll help most of us to accomplish day to day tasks without having a fully running client.

Version 2 expands on this vision to offer:
- Generate and send offline transactions, ensuring your private keys never leave your computer.
- Include custom gas / data in the standard send transaction tab.
- Rewritten in Angular in order to make it was easier to update and maintain.
- Crowdsale / Token Sale support on a case by case basis (Digix, Slock.it, etc.)
- New encryption method. Now matches geth / Mist keystore format (v3) to make moving between MyEtherWallet and Mist *much* easier.
- QR codes on the Offline Transaction page for easier transferring between computers.
- Ability to create a custom link that will pre-fill the send transaction tab with the to address, amount, data, and gas. All the user has to do is unlock their wallet and press send.
